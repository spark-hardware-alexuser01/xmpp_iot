Our initial goal for this project was to implement as many of the IoT XEPs as we
reasonably could, and then to perform Security and Scalability testing and
analysis on our implementation. However, for reasons explained in [SECTION], we
had a fair amount of difficulty getting a good start. Our initial plan was to
implement the Control \& Sensor XEPs, then Provisioning, and finally Concentrator
\& Discovery if we had time.
