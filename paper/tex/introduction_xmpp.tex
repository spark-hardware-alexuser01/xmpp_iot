XMPP sends messages using XML streams over a TCP connection. An XML stream is a 
container for the exchange of XML elements between any two entities over 
a network\cite{rfc3920}. To summarize, a TCP connection is established, authenticated, and then bound. The nodes exchange XML stanzas, which is a discrete semantic unit of structured information that is sent from one entity to another over an XML stream. The stream is closed after the exchange, and the TCP connection is closed thereafter.
