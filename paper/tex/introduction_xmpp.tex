XMPP sends messages using XML streams over a TCP connection. An XML stream is 
defined[e] as a container for the exchange of XML elements between any two 
entities over a network [REFERENCE 4]. To summarize, a TCP connection is 
established, authenticated, and then bound. The nodes exchange XML stanzas, 
which are defined as [f]a discrete semantic unit of structured information 
that is sent from one entity to another over an XML stream. The stream is 
closed after the exchange, and the TCP connection is closed thereafter.
