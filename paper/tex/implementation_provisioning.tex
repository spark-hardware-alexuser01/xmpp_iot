Currently all of the stanza data scructures needed for the Provisioning extended
protocol are in place. We are currently developing what we can of the mechanics
of getting a client and server component of Provisioning to work.

Since there is no XMPP server developed on top of SleekXMPP we had to go with
another server to connect via a server component gateway. This allows us to
continue to develop a functional Provisioning server without having to develop
in any given serverâ€™s native language. We decided to be testing and attaching
our Provisioning server component to a Podos server.

What still needs to be done is developing a functional simulated devices
utilizing the Provisioning protocol and the Server component that the devices
will be communicating with to handle the provisioning protocol. Such things
apart of the needed component implementations is attaching the Sleek code to
maintain its state either in memory or in a database for future scalability.
This would maintain friendships, tokens, certificates, etc.
