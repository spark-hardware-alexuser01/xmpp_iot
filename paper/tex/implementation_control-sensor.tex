XEPs Control and Sensor were already partially implemented as plugins of the
SleekXMPP library, so we decided to build off of that existing code and to start
developing Provisioning. The existing XEP partial implementations provided us
with a helpful reference when we began to develop Provisioning.

While both the Control and Sensor XEP implementations in SleekXMPP have minimal
functionality, they are both still incomplete. Neither implementation is pep8
compliant, both are confusing for new developers of XMPP IoT, and Control
doesnâ€™t support get forms (See [SECTION] about getforms). We performed a
syntactic cleanup and some slight refactoring of the SleekXMPP code to reduce
these problems.
