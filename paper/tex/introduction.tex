Internet of Things (IoT) refers to an idea that has been around since 1991\footnote{1} 
that eventually all objects in the world will link into one large network. Having all things linked in this way would require all things to have microchips, or some sort of way to exchange and receive data. This network of Things would result in astounding changes to all aspects of life. Some examples include monitoring agriculture, parts to an airplane, and controlling all aspects of a home.
Multiple messaging protocols are established with the goal of accomplishing IoT in the best possible fashion. Protocols in development for IoT include the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), and MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT)\footnote{2}. In this paper, we observe and critique XMPP, which contains protocol extensions specifically catered to IoT.
