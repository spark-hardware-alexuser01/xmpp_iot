Internet of Things (IoT) refers to an idea that has been around since 1991 
[REFERENCE NEEDED] based upon[a] all objects in the world linking into one 
large network. Having all things linked in this way would require all things 
to have microchips, or some sort of way to exchange and receive data. This 
network of Things would result in astounding changes to all aspects of life. 
Some examples include monitoring agriculture, parts to an airplane, and 
controlling all aspects of a home.

Multiple messaging protocols have been established[b] with the goal of 
accomplishing IoT in the best possible fashion. Protocols in development for 
IoT include the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), Constrained 
Application Protocol (CoAP), and MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT) [REFERENCE 
NEEDED]. We observed and critiqued[c] XMPP, which has extensions to the 
protocol that are created specifically for IoT[d].
