Having different protocols for setting and getting has a negative effect on the
user due to one particular informational flag that is settable in Sensor Data.
The `controllable` flag, which is optionally set in Sensor Data, indicates
whether a field is settable or not. However, being settable means that the
Control XEP is able to set it, which is defined by behavior in the Control
protocol. So a programmer could make a mistake and mark a certain field as
`settable` through the Sensor Data protocol, when it all reality Control cannot
even touch it. This could cause lots of confusion for a user that wishes to view
control parameters through the read command of Sensor Data rather than the
getForm command of Control.

Provisioning only has a notion of access rights for individual friends and
doesn't allow for groupings. This prevents group properties or means of group
relationships which may result in more work for managing trust relationships for
end users than effectively necessary.
